# Predicting the prices of second hand bikes(used bikes) using AIML techniques.

1. Project Objectives : The main objective of this research project is to build an effective AIML model which will predict the prices of used bikes to potential buyers or sellers to facilitate informed decision-making.
2. Data Collection : Gathered a comprehensive dataset containing information about used bikes. This dataset includes features(independent variables) such as bike specifications (brand, model, mileage, engine capacity, etc.), seller location, kilo meters driven, age of bike and price of bike(dependent variable). Collected data from various sources such as online marketplaces, classified ads and from some github repositories.
3. Data Preprocessing : Cleaned and preprocesses the collected data to ensure its quality and consistency. This involves handling missing values and outliers, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing formats. Additionally, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
4. Data Splitting : Splits the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train your machine learning models, while the testing set will be used to evaluate their performance and generalization ability. We used 80% of processed data for model training and the remaining 20% for testing the performace of the model.
5. Model Selection : Since my dependent variable (Price of bike) is continuous variable i have gone through regression techniques. Since because there is a non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables we choosed ensemble learning and regularization techniques to build the models.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of your chosen model(s) to optimize their performance. Used random search technique to systematically search for the best combination of hyperparameters.
7. Out of all the models trained Random Forest model performing better than any other models.
